## ABOUT:
The project e-MAS is very useful for the person who is in a medical emergency. It is available 24x7. You
can use this whenever you want that’s why it is named “The 24x7 Medical Assistance Software”. It mainly
solves the problem of “What to do in a medical emergency?”. It provides various health-related solutions

tests, purchase medical equipment or medicines and save all the details of your orders or bookings using
a print option which saves details in a file on your device. It is very simple and easy to understand. It is
also easy to use just you have to run the code and enter the details of what it asks. The concept of Java
language mainly the java swing class is used for its development. It is made on Visual Studio Code IDE. To
run this code properly on your device you just need to install JDK and VS Code software along with two
extensions code runner and an extension pack for java. It also has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) which
makes it more user-friendly. This project is a front-end project.

## METHODOLOGY:
I implemented this project with different concepts of Java and OOPS principles such as classes,
objects, methods, constructors, inheritance, exception handling, file handling, and Java Swing which is
a GUI-based toolkit for Java.
There are many types of classes in this project like Ambulance.java, Appointment.java, LabTest.java,
Decision.java, Medicine_and_equipments.java, and medicine_recommendation.java which are all
linked with Mainproject.java and there are various methods and constructors in that classes which
helps in the proper functioning of the project. 

## SOFTWARE & HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
A Computer or a laptop with the following requirements and JDK (Java Development Kit) is also
installed on the system to make it run properly.

**Software Requirements:**

OS: Windows, Mac, or Linux 

**Hardware Requirements:**
PROCESSOR: Minimum INTEL i3 / AMD RYZEN 3
RAM: Minimum 2 gigabytes
ARCHITECTURE: 32-bit or 62-bit

## DEPLOYMENT:
To deploy this project just open it in any of the IDE as mentioned in the Software requirements and run **mainproject.java** source file.
To find the saved booking details, you can follow the path **project code/project bookings**
